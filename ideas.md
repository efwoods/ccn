Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between inputs, outputs, and model weights, will output models weights and biases given input data and output data as input (or an objective prompt). The creator is then trained on itself to make a creation. the creation in turn learns the creator as input, learns itself and outputs a creation. This is the relationship between the creation-creator-network model pair. The path towards superintelligence.


Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between data input, data output, and the model weights and biases of trained models. The creators take model weights, input and output data for the input model, and outputs model weights. Once validated and trained, the model is used on itself to make a creation. The creation is superior to the creator and consumes the creator during training to eventually output a creation.


The key is that the Creator model understands the latent weights such that they are no longer latent.
The output weights and biases of the Creation are tested against the input data and output data of a known working model. The weights and biases and performance of the Creation are compared against the original input model. The point at which the Creator outputs model weights and biases such that the Creation is an improved version of the original model is the point that the Creator has been trained. 

The Creator then accepts the models, its own weights and outputs another Creation that is itself a Creator model. Then the process repeats.

There should be a process to make parts of models in conjunction to create Titans: models that are gargantuan and take many Creators to output.

The Titan is superintelligence.

I want to create a model to create language models. This model accepts input data and output data and model weights of a trained and tested working model and outputs model weights that are improved in any domain. Once the model is trained and the output model weights are as performant or better than the original model weights when tested on a hold out set of the input data, I want to use this model on itself to create a hyper-performant model that creates models using the model's own model weights. This new model must then be tested on the same process of the previous model step using the same input and output data as well as known model weights to output model weights. If successful, this new output model weights will immediately be hyper performant or at least as performant as the original model weights. I want to use very tiny models to start with so as to train and test locally and use models that are established as high-performant with a public dataset of input and output data. Please consider, evaluate, synthesize, and describe this process in detail.

This most likely uses langGraph deep agents to orchestrate the construction of a Titan AI

To be clear, these are not weight updates solely, they are architectural changes of the neural network to create a resulting neural network (weights and biases and nodes) that is optimized. Once an output model is as performant or better, the model is used on itself to create an optimized version of the model creator. This model is tested on the original model (with input and output data). The result of the test should be an immediate performance improvement of a model that is output. This is a model that learns to create models, learns how the model learned to create models, and creates a better model that learns how to build models. This process starts small and grows in model size until the model is beyond gargantuan. 

Milestones include:
- creating a model using a known working model with a known input and output dataset (any performance)
- creating a model using a known working model with a known input and output dataset (baseline or improved performance)
- creating a model using the model builder itself 
- testing the created model builder on the original known working model (any performance)
- testing the created model builder on the original known working model (baseline or improved perfomance output resulting model (instant))
- iterating this processes again to make an even larger model (or more efficient; there may be inefficiencies in model structure with 400 billion parameter models and no known knowledge of how the model weights precisely relate to the input and output data. Once the model weights are attended to with respect to the data, the model will learn to understand the relationship between input data, output data, and model weights. The builder model will then be used on itself to create a better builder. The builder model should be used on models and data that the model has not been exposed to to create new models as a test. If successful, the model should build models based upon input data, output data, and models weights, biases, and node architecture without having been exposed to the model before. This process will lead to the development of Superintelligent models.
