Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between inputs, outputs, and model weights, will output models weights and biases given input data and output data as input (or an objective prompt). The creator is then trained on itself to make a creation. the creation in turn learns the creator as input, learns itself and outputs a creation. This is the relationship between the creation-creator-network model pair. The path towards superintelligence.


Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between data input, data output, and the model weights and biases of trained models. The creators take model weights, input and output data for the input model, and outputs model weights. Once validated and trained, the model is used on itself to make a creation. The creation is superior to the creator and consumes the creator during training to eventually output a creation.
