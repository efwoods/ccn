Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between inputs, outputs, and model weights, will output models weights and biases given input data and output data as input (or an objective prompt). The creator is then trained on itself to make a creation. the creation in turn learns the creator as input, learns itself and outputs a creation. This is the relationship between the creation-creator-network model pair. The path towards superintelligence.


Creator-Creation-Network: Definition of LLMs that understand the attended relationship between data input, data output, and the model weights and biases of trained models. The creators take model weights, input and output data for the input model, and outputs model weights. Once validated and trained, the model is used on itself to make a creation. The creation is superior to the creator and consumes the creator during training to eventually output a creation.


The key is that the Creator model understands the latent weights such that they are no longer latent.
The output weights and biases of the Creation are tested against the input data and output data of a known working model. The weights and biases and performance of the Creation are compared against the original input model. The point at which the Creator outputs model weights and biases such that the Creation is an improved version of the original model is the point that the Creator has been trained. 

The Creator then accepts the models, its own weights and outputs another Creation that is itself a Creator model. Then the process repeats.

There should be a process to make parts of models in conjunction to create Titans: models that are gargantuan and take many Creators to output.

The Titan is superintelligence.
